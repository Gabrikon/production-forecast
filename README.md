Oil and Water Production Forecasting Web ApplicationThis project is a simple Flask web application that provides historical visualization and future forecasts for oil (NET bbls/d) and water (WATER bbls/d) production based on a pre-trained XGBoost model.Users can input the number of future days they want to forecast, and the application will display interactive charts showing both historical data and the generated forecast.FeaturesLoads historical production data from a CSV file.Loads pre-trained XGBoost models and scalers.Generates future production forecasts using bootstrapping and the loaded models.Displays historical data and future forecasts using interactive Chart.js plots.Allows users to specify the number of days for the forecast.PrerequisitesBefore running this application, ensure you have the following installed:Python 3.6 or higherpip (Python package installer)You will also need the following files in the root directory of the project:filled_oil.csv: The historical production data.final_models.joblib: The saved XGBoost models for 'NET (bbls/d)' and 'WATER (bbls/d)'.feature_scaler.joblib: The saved scaler for the features.target_scalers.joblib: The saved scaler for the targets ('NET (bbls/d)' and 'WATER (bbls/d)').Project Structure.

SetupClone the repository:git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-repository-name>
Create a virtual environment:It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:On macOS and Linux:source venv/bin/activate
On Windows:.\venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:Install the required Python packages using the requirements.txt file.pip install -r requirements.txt
Place required files:Ensure filled_oil.csv, final_models.joblib, feature_scaler.joblib, and target_scalers.joblib are in the root directory of the project (the same directory as app.py).Running the ApplicationActivate your virtual environment (if you haven't already).Run the Flask application:python app.py
The application will start a development server, typically at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.Open in browser:Open your web browser and navigate to the address shown in the terminal (usually http://127.0.0.1:5000/).Using the Web InterfaceOnce the application is running and you access it in your browser:You will see an input field labeled "Number of Periods to Forecast:".Enter the desired number of future days for the forecast.Click the "Get Forecast" button.The application will generate the forecast and display two charts below: one for NET Oil Production and one for WATER Production, showing both historical data and the generated forecast.DeploymentFor deploying this application to a public web server (like PythonAnywhere, Render, Heroku, etc.), you will typically need a production-ready WSGI server like Gunicorn (already included in requirements.txt) and potentially a Procfile (included in the project structure section above) depending on the hosting platform. Refer to your chosen hosting provider's documentation for specific deployment steps.Feel free to expand on this README with more details about your model, data sources, or any future plans for the project!
